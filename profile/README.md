# Welcome to Nutrient
Our team was inspired by the eating lifestyle in Indonesia. Most Indonesians don’t adopt a healthy lifestyle and don’t pay attention to serving portions. Our team chose the topic "HealthCare" for creating the capstone project. The application we created carries content such as scanning nutrition labels whose data will be processed into information that is useful for monitoring health aspects based on the Body Mass Index of the user and search for details on the nutritional content of food and beverage products circulating in Indonesia. Through this Nutrient application, people will be more concerned about health through the value of nutritional content consumed.

## Main Project Scope and Delivarables
- Application dashboard
- Scan the nutrition label
- Recommended articles and Search Articles
- Search product
- History of data
- BMI Terms Status

## Role of Learning Path
**Machine Learning** 
- Building machine learning model to receive real-time nutritional
information based on the nutrition label images using detection box and OCR. This
model could then be integrated to allow users to capture nutrition label images.

**Mobile Development** 
- Our mobile development team works on building android
applications that contain 7 important features in the project scope. We build
applications with Kotlin programming language and Android Studio IDE, supported
by Figma platform for user interface design needs. Our team combines all machine
learning models, APIs, and networking to be applied to the Nutrient application.

**Cloud Computing** 
- We are building the cloud infrastructure for our backend service.
We plan to use compute engine to deploy our API. We are going to create Cloud
storage for storage management. The database will be using a relational database.
Other than deploying we are also going to manage the service by building
monitoring. We are building the backend application using laravel. The feature
includes authentication for users. Connect machine learning model to API and
create all API auth, financials, profile, uncategorized and machine learning api.
